            I'm Joseph Monreal, Developer and Designer. I grew up in a small town in Arizona called Nogales. After highschool I attended the University of Arizona where I received a Bachelor of General Studies Degree with an Emphasis in Science and Technology. I really got into development my sophomore year when I took my first development course. I was introduced to Java and right then and there I realized what a fun and powerful skill this can turn into overtime. My two favorite courses that I took at the UofA were a Front-End Development course and an Algorithm Informatic Application course. 
            
            <br><br> Within the Front-End Development course I was basically taught how everything comes together when developing websites from using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and PHP. Within the course we built 10 different projects that all progressed into being bigger and more meaningful projects that apply to daily business needs. This course really opened up my eyes on what I wanted to pursue as a career and do for the rest of my life. 
            
            <br><br>The other course that I took was based on the Python programming language. I personally love Python over other programming languages I have used. Python is definitely my favorite language due to its simplicity and power with so very little lines of code. Within this course I was learning how to write algorithms for applications and learned a lot about topics such as data structures, classes, object-oriented programming, beautiful soup, web scraping, and integrating statistics with code for graphing. 
            
            <br><br>On the side I continue to engage myself with side projects and hope to land a position within a company so I can contribute and be a valuable resource.
